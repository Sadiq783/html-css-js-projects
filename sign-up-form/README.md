# Sign Up Form

## Description

This is a small sign-up form that allows users to enter their full name, email address, and password.  
The project focuses on clean UI, proper form structure, and basic accessibility best practices.

## Features

- User-friendly sign-up form
- Accessible form structure using labels
- Screen-reader-friendly hidden labels
- Clean and responsive layout

## What I Learned

- The importance of accessibility when structuring HTML forms
- How to properly use labels for form inputs
- How to visually hide labels while keeping them accessible to screen readers
- Better understanding of semantic and accessible UI design

## Challenges Faced

- Initially, I relied only on placeholders for input fields.
- Later, I realized that placeholders alone are not accessible.
- To solve this, I added proper labels and visually hid them using CSS while keeping them available for screen readers.
