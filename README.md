# HTML, CSS & JavaScript Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-scale projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The purpose of this repository is to practice core web development concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain a well-documented learning journey.

Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept or feature of front-end web development (HTML, CSS & JS).

## Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and follows a clean, scalable structure:

    project-name/
    ├── index.html
    ├── css/
    │ └── style.css
    ├── js/
    │ └── script.js
    ├── assets/
    │ └── images / icons / fonts
    └── README.md

Each project folder contains its own README.md explaining the implementation details and learnings.

## What I’m Focusing On

- Writing semantic HTML
- Building responsive layouts
- Understanding JavaScript fundamentals deeply
- Improving code structure and clarity

## Progress & Updates

This repository is actively maintained.
New projects and improvements are added regularly as part of continuous learning.

## Disclaimer

These projects are built for learning and practice purposes.
Code quality and structure improve over time as my understanding evolves.
